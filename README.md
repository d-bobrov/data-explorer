In today's data-driven world, the ability to explore and understand data is crucial. However, many non-technical individuals struggle with SQL queries and have a hard time verifying if their SQL gives the correct result. Data Explorer is here to help. With Data Explorer, you can query your data using natural language or even translate SQL queries into natural language. Simply ask a question or state a request in plain English, and Data Explorer will convert that into SQL to be executed against your database.

This tool supports a wide range of databases including SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. It's designed to be user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users, from business analysts to product managers.

## Features

- **Natural Language Querying**: Query your data using natural language. Data Explorer will convert your questions or requests into SQL to be executed against your database. This feature is powered by advanced AI techniques to ensure accurate and meaningful results.

- **SQL to Natural Language Translation**: Understand complex SQL queries in plain English. Simply type '?' followed by your SQL query and Data Explorer will provide a natural language explanation of what the query does. This feature is particularly useful when trying to understand complex queries written by others, or when you want to verify that your own query does what you intend it to do.

- **Support for Multiple Databases**: Data Explorer supports SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. This wide range of database support ensures that you can use Data Explorer regardless of your database of choice.

- **SQL Support**: Data Explorer fully supports SQL. This means that users can use as much or as little SQL as they want, providing flexibility for those with varying levels of SQL knowledge.

- **Self-Hosted Large Language Model**: For companies that cannot use chat GPT, Data Explorer provides the option to deploy a self-hosted large language model trained on text to SQL data. This ensures that even without chat GPT, users can still enjoy the benefits of AI-powered data exploration.

## What Makes Us Unique

While large language models are powerful, they can sometimes hallucinate and produce results that don't make sense. At Data Explorer, we've taken steps to mitigate this issue. We have a powerful query analyzer that detects syntactically incorrect or potentially dangerous queries. This ensures that your database won't be destroyed or overwhelmed by a large query. Our priority is to provide you with accurate, meaningful insights while keeping your data safe and secure.
